    Wojo is a unit price for a particular work for a specific skill level. Wojo
    brings technology to connect the skills and work gap. Wojo finds a persons
    ablity to do a particular tasks and provides him work in unit forms. Wojo
    finds the actual value to do the task and makes sure that people get paid
    instantly for the work they do. Wojo platform also keeps scoring for skills
    added, work previosuly done and all other aspects for talent building. All
    of this builds a perfect system for a more efficient substitute to work done
    in corporate setting.
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    Wojo believes that for centuries the way work is done has not been
    challenged well. Microworks platforms are still not focusing on the right
    problems. We need traditional companies to see value and ease in doing work
    through microtasks. When this comfortability is achieved and work is
    presented to right skills in right way, inflection will come.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
